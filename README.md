# What is this?

The user interface design that was implemented became the first React.js I made. then what about "Goofys"? I dunno, at this time the page made is pricing plans as a basic material for my learning to make front-end web with React.js.

You can see the prototype design of this project on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bLGt4aUSXJIYWI2fL1PAJp/Goofys-Pricing?t=HUfvXeNcYc2iKule-1).

Feel free to customize.

# Let's get started

## Installations

Make sure you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for local development, or you can use [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).

This project does not store React in the repo, so install these modules

- react
- react-dom
- classnames
- bootstrap

also I added bootstrap, I recommend using the latest version 5.3.0 or above

or use the following command line
```
npm install react react-dom classnames bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3
```

## Run

To run the project, you can use this command line
```
npm start
```
Usually will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the existing browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
